Partially Complete 
- None observed in manual tests. Prompts/messages are concise; adjust wording if your autograder expects exact strings.
- Scope intentionally excludes AI opponent and GUI (not required by spec).

Quick Manual Tests 
- n=3; P1='X', P2='O'; moves: 1,2,4,5,7 ⇒ Player 'X' wins (first column).
- Fill board without a winning line ⇒ “It’s a draw!” shown with final board.
